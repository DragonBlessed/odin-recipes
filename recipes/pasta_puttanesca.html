<h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 28 oz can of  tomatoes, preferably special cut, not whole</li>
        <li>2 Anchovy fillets</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped finely</li>
        <li>Hot pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup Kalamata olives, halved</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese for garnish</li>
        <li>Parsley flakes OR fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

<h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by putting a pot of water on to boil for the pasta. Then, chop or grate your garlic, start heating the oil over medium heat, and while that is warming up, halve your olives.
 </li>
        <li>Once your oil is hot, pop your anchovy fillets down and let them brown up along with a good 2 shakes of the hot pepper flakes. 
            If you don’t like spicy things, you can use less or none, but if you do like spice, feel free to put as much in as you like.</li>
        <li>Break them up with a spatula, and then add in the garlic. Let it cook for about 1 minute, but don’t let the garlic burn! 
            It’ll burn in the blink of an eye. I almost let mine burn. As you can see, the garlic is quite brown.</li>
        <li>Then, pour in your tomatoes, and break them up into pieces with your spatula, if you got whole tomatoes. You want it to be a saucy texture, with maybe a few pieces of tomato. 
            Throw in the olives, a few grates of pepper, and give everything a good stir. Taste your sauce, and adjust flavors accordingly.</li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, once your water boils, salt the water to impart flavor on the pasta, and then add in your spaghetti and cook to the instructions on the package.
            You’ll know the pasta is done when the inside has just the smallest pin prick of white.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done, drain it and dish out your servings. Spoon sauce on the top and sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley.
        </li>
        <li>Now it’s done! Grab a plate and dig in!</li>
