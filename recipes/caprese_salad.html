<h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
<h6>Mozzarella</h6>
<ol>
    <li>Start by combining 1 ½ teaspoon of citric acid with 1 cup of cool, clear, non-chlorinated water and whisk together in a small bowl. 
            In a separate bowl, combine a ¼ cup of cool, clear, non-chlorinated water with a ¼ teaspoon of rennet and whisk together. 
    </li>
    <li>In a large stockpot, pour the citric acid mixture in along with 1 gallon of whole milk and set over medium-low heat. 
            Stir slowly and bring the milky mixture to 90°F. Kill the heat and pull the pot off the second it hits 90°F. 
            Add the rennet mixture while mixing with an up and down method for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>After 30 seconds, pop a pot lid on and let rest for at least 5 minutes. 
            After 5 minutes, the curd should look like a layer of fat-free greek style yogurt has formed on the top. 
            Using a long thin knife, cut the curd into 1” pieces - being sure that the tip of the knife hits the bottom of the pot with each stroke.</li>
    <li>Then return to medium-low heat and gently stir the mixture until it reaches 110°F. 
            It is essential not to go any higher or lower than 110°F otherwise the cheese will come out squeaky.</li>
    <li>Remove the pot from the heat and continue to gently stir until the curds soften and become extremely gelatinous, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Over a separate pot, ladle the curds into a fine-mesh sieve, season with 1 teaspoon of cheese salt and remove the tons and tons of excess whey. 
            For an easier method, lift the cheese up and tilt the sieve to remove the majority of the whey.</li>
    <li>Return all of the excess whey back to the main pot over medium-high heat and bring the whole mixture up to 175°F. 
            This mixture will be used to help heat and stretch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Using a fine-mesh ladle, dip a third of the curd into the hot whey and pull it out and begin to stretch it like taffy. 
            Stretch it out and fold onto itself about 4-6 times, re-dipping as necessary to soften it up. 
            Once it has become soft and shiny and elastic, form it into a ball the same way as bread dough, pressing up between the fingers with the thumb making a taut little ball.</li>
    <li>In order for the mozzarella to keep its shape, it must be chilled quickly. Place in a bowl of cold water with 2 tablespoons of whey, 3-4 ice cubes, and a pinch of kosher salt. 
            Mix together and drop the mozzarella balls in and store in the fridge for up to 4 days in their brine.</li>
        
<h6>Anchovy-Seaweed Dressing</h6>
<ol>
    <li>
            Start by mincing 1 whole anchovy (basically into a powder) and chopping 1 piece of dried seaweed. 
            Place into a bowl along with 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, the juice of half a lemon, 
            2 tablespoons of olive oil, a pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, and two splashes of balsamic vinegar.</li>
    <li>Mix together using a tiny whisk or pour into a tiny mason jar and give it a shake.</li>
    <li>Now it’s done! Grab a plate and dig in!</li>
</ol>

<h6>Assembly</h6>
<ol>
    <li>On a plate, place 2 leaves of lettuce, 2 small cuts from a piece of toast then stack 5 slices of tomato 
            with 4 thinly sliced pieces of mozzarella alternating from the left side.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with the anchovy seaweed dressing and top with two basil leaves.</li>
