I will be showcasing what I learned in the HTML portion of TOP by coding an HTML recipe website.
I will be using recipes from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
By the end of this project, I hope to have incorporated my HTML and cooking knowledge, along with some creativity, into the website. 
Note: forgot to add the project to Github, so there won't be any changes listed during the creation.
